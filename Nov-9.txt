November 9 - 10:18pm 
Updated by: Simon
Major Updates:
	Server messages window colourising has been added. The main function appears
	in actionsMod.bas module file as "setcolor". This uses the enumeration of the
	colour names in the same file. This function is at the moment used by AddText
	function in ClientMain form (mainForm.frm) and subsequently all statements 
	that call AddText locally from ClientMain form.

	frmAbout form (about.frm) has been changed to reflect the team work. 
Minor Updates:
	Minor release number has been changed from 1.2 to 1.9 beta.
Suggestions:
	Please use this format for logging updates. Preferably using the same file for
	this week or month. Next update should therefore be added to the top of this
	file. Please note down all files changed and any major updates, not including
	minor bug fixes. That is, All major bugs and new feature should be logged.
Files changed:
	actionsMod
	ClientMain.frm
	about.frm
